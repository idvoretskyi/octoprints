# octoprints

GitHub's all-star mascots, now ready to 3D print. [Rubber duck debugging](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) has never been so cute.

## Models

Each mascot has its own folder with STL files for printing, as well as optional 3MF files for multi-color prints and other optimized configurations.

- [Mona](./models/mona) - Every developer's best friend forever.
- [Copilot](./models/copilot) - Your AI pair programmer to get stuff done.
- [Ducky](./models/ducky) - Always ready to listen but will never judge.

## Multi-color printing

We printed these models using [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio) and a [Bambu Lab X1C printer](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon) with an AMS (Automatic Material System). The 3MF files in each model's folder are set up for this printer and software, but you can adapt them for other multi-color printing setups.

> [!TIP]
> The nature of Bambu Lab's AMS means that there is a certain amount of filament waste when switching colors. We recommend carefully reviewing the slice results in Bambu Studio before printing to understand how much filament will be consumed. A great way to minimize the relative waste is to print multiple copies of a model in a single print job. While the waste will be the same, it will be a smaller percentage of the total filament used.

Multiple colors not your jam? The mascots look great in a single color too. Maybe a bit of paint to add some details after printing? Go wild and share what you create with us!
